# Taiterbot
#Simple triggerbot built in Taite's laboratory using C++.  C++ isn't taught at my University but I've had a lot of fun with it on other personal projects, like OregonCore. I wanted to extend its application to developing a very simple but fun color-triggerbot.  This is the Lite version of Taiterbot.
