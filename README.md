# Taiterbot
### Simple triggerbot in C++.
C++ isn't taught at my University but I've had a lot of fun with it on other personal projects, like OregonCore. I wanted to extend its application to developing a very simple and fun color actuated triggerbot.  
This is the bare-bones Lite version of Taiterbot, that which is a much more feature rich and complete cheat for Overwatch and other applications.
